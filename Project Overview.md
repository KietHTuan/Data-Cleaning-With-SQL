# Data Cleaning Project with SQL

## Overview

This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning using SQL, covering a comprehensive range of tasks from data loading and database creation to advanced operations such as adding and deleting rows, tables, and columns. I address data inconsistencies, handle nulls and duplicates, leverage joins, and utilize essential SQL functions including CASE and ALTER. (see SQL codes in Sql_queries)

## Key tasks 
**1. Data loading and database creation**
   
   (Efficiently load data into SQL databases using backup restoration database.
    Create a backup structured database to organize and manage the dataset.)
    
**2. Data deletion**

   (Utilize the DELETE statement to remove specific rows or entries that do not meet data quality standards.
    Safely delete unnecessary tables and columns.)

**3. Handling nulls and duplicates values**

**4. Columns format modification**

   (Modify column formats to align with standard conventions and enhance data readability.)

**5. Create a criteria column using the CASE function**
